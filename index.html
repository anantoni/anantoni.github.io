<h2 class="text-white">About Me</h2>
<p align="justify" class="f4 mb-4 text-white">My name is Anastasios Antoniadis. I am a PhD
student at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications at University of
Athens. I started my PhD on October 2016 under the supervision of professor
Yannis Smaragdakis and I am a member of the programming languages and software
technologies research group of the department&mdash;<a                                                 
href="https://plast-lab.github.io">PLaST</a>.
<br>
I am also the creator and writer of "Borderpolar", <a                                                 
href="https://borderpolar.com">a blog specializing in tech news and reviews</a>. 
<br>
My main research area is static points-to analysis of Java programs. In
particular, my focus is on large-scale Java applications, such as Java EE
applications and static analysis scalability under highly precise
context-sensitivity.
<br>
<br>
In the past I worked as a research assistant at Oracle Labs Australia in 2019 for 5 months.
I was also an intern at CERN for a year in 2012-2013.
